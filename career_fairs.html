	    <h1 id="kickstart">How to Kickstart Your Career in Computer Science</h1>

	<p>The prospect of finding summer employment can seem daunting and it can be difficult to know where to get started. The following is a consolidated list of resources and tips to help you kickstart your career in CS!</p>
	  
	  <h2 id="tech_fair">McGill Tech Fair</h2>
	  
	  <p>This is your one-stop shop to speak to ~100 companies, drop off resumes, and apply to jobs you wouldn’t otherwise know were available. This takes place every semester during the beginning half of the semester. It’s an opportunity to speak to recruiters about education requirements, salary expectations, corporate cultures, job requirements, industry growth and trends, and skills and qualifications. It can seem intimidating to students starting out in CS, but don’t be put off by your perceived lack of experience, you can gain experience networking and learn which skills to can focus on to make you a more attractive candidate!</p>
	  
	  <p>For more information and to take a look at the companies who’ve participated in the past <a href="http://www.mcgilltechfair.com/?controller=pages&action=display&pg=students">click here</a>.
	
	  <h2 id="portals">MyFuture, Company Websites, and Job Search Engines</h2>
	  
	  <p>A lot of companies target McGill students via <a href="https://csm-mecc.mcgill.ca/students/">MyFuture</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Be proactive</b> and check the websites of the companies you’re interested in frequently. A lot of companies such as Google, Microsoft, Expedia, the list goes on, have application deadlines as early as September and October so it is never too early to start applying! A lot more companies will open up applications in January and February for summer internships, so it is especially important to keep an eye out during this time.</p>
	  
	  <p>As a rule of thumb, recruiting timelines tend to align with tech fair in both semesters so when you start brushing up your resume for tech fair, you’ll want to be checking out company websites for job postings.</p>
	  
	  <p>Lastly,  check job search engines such as  <a href="http://www.indeed.ca/">Indeed</a> , <a href="http://talentegg.ca/">Talent Egg</a> , and <a href="https://hired.com/">Hired</a>. The list is seemingly endless! These can feel like a void, but nonetheless a good tool for general job search.</p>
	  
	  <h2 id="hackathons">Hackathons</h2>
		  
	  <p>A lot of students can attest to hackathons being a great place to find jobs. The companies that sponsor these events will often send recruiters and company representatives to scope out for potential hires. This works to your advantage because they can see you in action and you can establish a connection inside of the company that you can reach out to once you apply.</p>
