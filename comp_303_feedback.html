<h2>COMP 303 Feedback</h2>
</div>
<h4>Syllabus Change from Fall 2013 to Fall 2014:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Project went from being worth 25% of total mark to 0%</li>
</ul>


<p>Students were concerned that their work was not being taken into consideration. Upon further review and discussion with Prof. Robillard, I find that this decision makes sense with the restrictions placed on the school.</p>

<ol>
<li>COMP 303 was first introduced to McGill in 2004; at this point it was a very small group of students, most of which had a good deal of programming experience. It was meant as a complementary course to discuss large software systems.</li>
<li>The only prerequisites to date are COMP 250, COMP 206, typical first-year courses with minimal programming components (in comparison to 303). Most of the students that seem to perform well in 303 according to Prof Robillard are those that have at least completed 251 and, in best case scenarios, internships where they've worked on larger-scale projects.</li>
<li>In the past two years, COMP 303 has been more difficult to teach and coordinate because of the wide range of experience of students taking the course:

<ul>
<li>This is particularly difficult when it comes to creating successful groups for group projects.</li>
<li>Fair division of work is difficult among students with different experience – for instance, those with less experience grouped with more experienced students may end up doing less work as those more experienced would not prefer to risk their mark with the inexperienced programmers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Much of the content of the course is based on thinking about programming designs at a high level. The best way of learning the content is implementing the solutions and seeing what works and what doesn't.

<ul>
<li>Programming <strong>is</strong> studying for this course! You need to implement the solutions and take the time before the exams to learn the material properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that the project is not a certain percentage of the mark, there are several benefits:

<ul>
<li>Students each get the opportunity to program all components of the project</li>
<li>Solutions can be discussed on the discussion boards freely and students can share solutions</li>
<li>No disadvantage to you if your teammates do not contribute to your group project</li>
<li>Learn/program at your pace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I cannot emphasize this point enough: Prof Robillard has fought hard to get <strong>great</strong> TAs for COMP 303 this semester. All of the TAs have taken 303 in the past with Prof Robillard and many are undergraduate TAs – this is a difficult feat considering the TA union protects graduate TAs. These TAs should ensure that with coordination with Prof Robillard, exams should be fair and graded equally fairly.</li>
</ol>


<p>Software design is a subjective process – your answer might differ from someone else's but be equally successful. With TAs that understand this aspect, you can feel more comfortable about the material and please use the discussion boards to your advantage!</p>
