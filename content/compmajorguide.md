> Welcome to computer science at McGill! 
> Whether you're a prospective student, entering your first semester, or well on your way to graduation, this guide was made with students in mind to help you better navigate the programs offered at McGill. We're a very active community on and off campus with important ties to the industry and academia; we're constantly posting on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mcgillcs/) about the latest technologies and academic concerns. Over the past few years, our current council has found that although there are many of us that know how to navigate the program, there'll always be a few left in the dark. This guide is our solution: we hope to bring all of our students to the same page and provide as much wisdom and knowledge as possible so as to make your journey as fun as possible!

##Choosing the Right Program

This text is an adapted version of the similar material provided by the School of Computer Science on the previous version of the cs.mcgill.ca website (2012 and earlier).
The [School of Computer Science](cs.mcgill.ca) offers a variety of programs both within the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science.

###Bachelor of Science, B.Sc. (Faculty of Science)

Most of our students choose a B.Sc. degree program. The B.Sc. degree is suitable for you if:

+ you are coming from a high school program outside of Quebec and you have enjoyed and succeeded in both mathematics and science; or
+ you are coming from any CEGEP program from within Quebec with the necessary science prerequisites.

There are four main programs available in the B.Sc. program:
+ Major in computer science (also available with a computer games option)
+ Honours in computer science
+ Major in software engineering
+ Honours in software engineering

Other programs include:
+ Major in computer science and biology
+ Major in computer science and physics
+ Major in computer science and mathematics
+ Major in computer science and statistics
+ Joint honours in computer science and statistics
+ Joint honours in computer science and mathematics

A major in computer science or software engineering provides a good general background in foundational and applied computer science. If focusing on software, you'll be exposed to more courses pertaining to the principled development of software. It contains ten core required courses, and three additional sets of courses from which to choose complementary courses; you can supplement your major with any 21 COMP credits at the 300-level or above.

If you are pursuing an honours major, you'll have fifteen required courses, two groups from which to choose complementary courses, and an additional 21 COMP credits to choose from at the 300-level or above. An Honours program gives you a deeper and more comprehensive education in computer science (and is particularly encouraged if you seek to attend graduate school) and requires a thesis.
