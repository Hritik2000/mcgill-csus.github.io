        <p class="lead intro" style="font-size:18px;">Our brand new initiative, the CSUS Fund, is now open for applications! Students who need financial assistance to attend CS related conferences can apply using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiWhC1byxg3Cei4GqzPi3ikfjSARCk3Z5xPqvPXdi-I/edit?usp=sharing">this form</a>. Note that this fund is not intended for students attending hackathons. Download the form, fill it out, and email the completed form to <a href="mailto:csus@cs.mcgill.ca">csus@cs.mcgill.ca</a>.</p>
	<p class="lead intro" style="font-size:18px;">Applicants should keep the following information in mind:</p>
 	<ul>
		<li style="font-size:18px;">Expect to find the cheapest mode of transportation</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px;">CSUS funds applicants to a maximum of 50% of conference cost or $250 (whichever is lowest)</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px;">If a similar event exists closer to Montreal/McGill, we are less likely to fund your application</li>
	</ul>

	  <td style="font-seize:18px;">Before I had applied to attend this conference, Lesbians Who Tech were an organization that I had recently learnt about. It was a collective that, for the first time in awhile, I felt a very close and personal connection to. The conference was a chance to be surrounded by like minded women, hear fantastic speakers, and see what the real face of the tech industry looked like. When I arrived in the meeting hall, I was greeted by many smiling faces and conversations (and free swag). The experience only got better from there. Throughout the weekend there were career fairs, talks and panels, workshops, a hackathon, and also free food which I was pretty stoked about. We also got to see some incredible guests, including Megan Smith (the United States Chief Technology Officer) and Edie Windsor. Not only did I learn a lot, but I managed to meet amazing women in technology who continue to inspire me.
Being able to get a ticket for the summit as well as funding from CSUS was an incredible opportunity, and ultimately made the trip possible for me. For those that are interested, I’d highly recommend applying to attend this summit, it’s definitely an experience not to be forgotten.</td>
